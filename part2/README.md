# Run The Project
Clone the repository to your vscode and run "npm install" then "npm start". This should take you to our YouTube home page. Enjoy!

# Working Process 
At first we started working on the login and sign up screens. We started by creating them visually and later we started adding the needed logic (makeing the buttons react, check inputs, save users, etc).
Then we moved on to the main YouTube screens. We started by making the home page, we craeted the needed components (like navbar, video snapshot, etc) and then moved on to a video watch screen (only visually). When we were done we made a video click move to the relevant page. then we started working and comments, likes, etc and we also added the option for searching videos. Later on we added the options for editing and deleting videos and comments and kept with little changes until we were done with everything.
